# tidbyt-manager
This is a very basic flask app for managing externally run applets for your tidbyt.  

default login in admin / password

docker needs port 8000 and 5100-5999 port range opened up (use --network=host to make it easy ((doesn't work on mac docker though))

set DOMAIN value in .env file if not running locally
